# AWS Chatbot Challenge
Chatbots are changing how companies interface with their customers. With chatbots, you can easily fulfill the needs of your customers in an automated way using natural, human-like chat interfaces. Chatbots serve a variety of use cases, such as customer support, transaction fulfillment, data retrieval, or even DevOps functions (ChatOps).
However, building and running chatbots is a difficult task. First, most developers lack the deep learning expertise necessary to create bots that can intelligently interpret and respond to text. In addition, developers must also provision, manage, and scale the compute resources necessary to run the botâ€™s code.
What if you could build chatbots with sophisticated natural language processing and almost no operational overhead? Amazon Lex is a fully managed service for building conversational interfaces into any application using voice and text. Lex is powered by the same deep learning technologies that power Amazon Alexa and lets you build natural language chatbots. Lex is integrated with AWS Lambda, a service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda enables you to write and run logic for your chatbot using serverless compute. Getting started with Amazon Lex and AWS Lambda is quick and easy.
